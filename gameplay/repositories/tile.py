        Theta* algorithm for any-angle pathfinding on a hex grid.

        Theta* extends A* by allowing shortcuts between non-adjacent nodes if there is a clear line-of-sight.

        Process:
          1. Use a priority queue similar to A*.
          2. For each neighbor of the current node, check if the parent of the current node has a direct
             line-of-sight to the neighbor.
          3. Use the parent's cost if a clear path exists, otherwise use the current node's cost.
          4. Update path data if a lower cost path is found.
